        Now check the static.domain_name file for entries, if a host has
        the same name, skip that host.  Otherwise tinydns will respond 
        with both the real server's IP AND the dhcp client's host, which
        is a potential security problem.

        Also removed tinydns_update.sh because dns_update.pl could call
        make just as easily as tinydns_update.sh.

        Fix make install to also check if DNSCACHEPATH exists.

	Bugfix - forgot a comma (moron), and didn't realize until I was 
	told that dhcpd stores times in GMT.  Thanks to Matthias Andree.

	Fixed a bug in the date comparison, that caused all comparisons to 
	return true.  Thanks to Jochen Erwied.

	Changed a few stupid errors in makefile, thanks to several people for
	pointing them out.  Sorry I hadn't gotten to fixing it.

	Thanks to Tiago N. Sampaio for finding a bug in my makefile :)

	Thanks to Nate Keegan <nate.keegan@cityofprescott.net> - apparently I
didn't think to allow configuring the dnscache path in the makefile.  That's
been fixed.

	First public release switched to djbdns.

	Thanks to Michael Matsumura <michael@limit.org>, we can now handle
reverse DNS entries.  The problem wasn't that there was a problem with my
program, it was my DNS setup.  I had actually coded the stuff before, but
removed it when I couldn't make it work.  Thanks Michael, for making me 
go back and work on this again.
